# Dissertation
This GitHub repository contains code accompanying my third-year project titled
"_A study on approximation techniques for Bayesian Logistic Regression_" which 
covers Laplace Approximation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational 
Methods. 

The work is based on 
* The original paper by Jaakkola and Jordan's 1996 
[paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e407/ea7fda6d152d2186f4b5e27aa04ec2d32dcd.pdf)
called "_A variational approach to Bayesian logistic regression models and 
their extensions_" and by the subsequent analysis done by Bishop (2006) in his 
"_Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_" 
[textbook](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf).
*  "_MCMC in Practice_" by David Spiegelhalter, Sylvia Richardson, and 
W. R. Gilks and many other good MCMC textbooks.
